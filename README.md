#### Created by Gabriel Gonzales, with special thanks to Gwynne Meeks, Hannah Hall, and Monica Kay.


Blessipe was founded on React/Python, deployed on [Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/), styled with elements from [Material UI](https://material-ui.com/), and represents my Full Stack Web Development capstone project at Nashville Software School. It was built in three weeks (including a planning phase), and my aim was to incorporate full CRUD functionality, build custom actions within Django, and let the data filtering and matching be handled on the back end.

##### Thank you so much for your time and for checking out my work. It means a lot. See you out there üç£
